Ok, where is the credentials.py file? 

Well, that's a good question and I have a good answer. It's because I don't want you to see my bot's token.

How do I fix it?

1) create a file named credentials.py
2) in credentials.py, create a variable 'TOKEN' and set it equal to your bot's token.

ex:

TOKEN = "3owierunif4bfe,dg"

No, that's not a real token.
